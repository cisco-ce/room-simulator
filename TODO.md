# Simulator TODO

- Add to github and github pages

- Show api panel
- Replace room system with board pro? (designer help)
- Use requestanimationframe instad of setInterval. test in other browsers
- Tweak ui extension panel. use emojis? add presets
- Make virtual sources work
- Toggle help (show clickable elements)



# What to keep from previous sim:
* Room visualistations of lights, shades, projectors
* Clickable elements
* Simulator for lights, shades, projecttor
* Mapping from xapi to internal model
* Possible to add / remove ui extension config easily (if not present)
* Virtual sources simulator (but might need improvement)

# What to change
* Host externally, connect to
* Better event viewer. show xapi events in full, simulate tshell?
* Dont use jquery, maybe not snap
* Remove virtual touch panel (for now)
* Add sounds


# If time and mood allows it:

Developer
- notify blind status properly, esp preset
- possible to rotate windows

Designer
- left wall: immersive window
- lights on canvas switches
- canvas: looks very dark when room is not 100% lit
- whiteboard path illustration (to animate)
- gradients in edges,corners
- person behind door perhaps not move?

- make table more narrow close to camera (like tower of hanoi)




## What I needed to do

- Understand how the whole thing worked
- Add webpack configuration and dev setup for project
- Hassle: Make snap work with webpack
- Remove web pack dependencies on requiring assets
- Refactor and improvements
- Integrate with Alpine for reactive ui (instead of jquery)
- Connect to video device dialog and logic
