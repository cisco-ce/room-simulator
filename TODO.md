# Simulator TODO

- Intro page when opening sim
- Replace room system with board pro? (designer help)
- Toggle help (show clickable elements)
- Turn on media devices from touch panel


# If time and mood allows it:

Developer
- notify blind status properly, esp preset
- possible to rotate windows

Designer
- left wall: immersive window
- lights on canvas switches
- canvas: looks very dark when room is not 100% lit
- whiteboard path illustration (to animate)
- gradients in edges,corners
- person behind door perhaps not move?

- make table more narrow close to camera (like tower of hanoi)




## What I needed to do

- Understand how the whole thing worked
- Add webpack configuration and dev setup for project
- Hassle: Make snap work with webpack
- Remove web pack dependencies on requiring assets
- Refactor and improvements
- Integrate with Alpine for reactive ui (instead of jquery)
- Connect to video device dialog and logic
